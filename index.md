Hi, I'm *Graeme*

Who are you?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience amazing things?

I love <a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">drupal</a>[^1],
I love <a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">Rangers</a>[^2] and my Fiance&eacute;	and play with most of the new technology I can get my hands on.

I enjoy open source culture and enjoy  working on an occasional open source project or two, usualy I end up building a site or two and then forgetting about them. This site will hopefully serve as a reminder of all my other sites(I need to put a list of them somewhere). I hope it doesn't also get lost in the mysts of time.
