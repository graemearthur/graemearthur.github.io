Hi, I'm *Graeme*. I am a 27 year old who lives and work's in *The UK* :)

I'm unique, I love <a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">drupal</a>[^1], I'm a **member** at <a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">Elim Church Crawley</a>[^2] I love Rangers and play with most of the new technology I can get my hands on.

I enjoy open source culture and enjoy  working on an occasional open source project or two, usualy I end up building a site or two and then forgetting about them. This site will hopefully serve as a reminder of all my other sites. I hope it doesn't also get lost in the mysts of time.
