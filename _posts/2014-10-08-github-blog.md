30 day blog challenge, done on github, working on writing and that's pretty much it.
<!-- more -->
after starting this blog I figure it needs some content, its a bit light in that area, obviously I can refine as I go, and realise how horrible it currently is.

I think I should set some rules at the start, 
1 post every day, small tweaks or fixes don't count as a *commit* for the day,
