It all started with github yes being part of the community there and being too much of a lurker I decided I needed to create something so I started playing around with Jekeyll Hopefully I managed to eventually cook up something that  is simple, easy to update and actually has a purpose.

As Time went on however I decided I needed a site where I could keep pointing back to, if it was drupal it'd be constantly being tweaked, updated and I'd try all sorts of things and yes then eventually abandon it.
Well the same may eventually happen to this site but at least I'm trying something else that has somewhat of a chance to succedd. 

## Getting my hands dirty

I'm a newbie using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hopefully it works currently and I'm guessing I'll add new bits to the site as needed, my big problem is keeping things only semi public... if you put a big link to it everyone will know it's there, if I don't put a big link to all the pages then I tend to forget about the hidden bits and they become out of date / disused etc.

Hopefully everyone will like the idea of me sucking it up and living in public somewhat with my crappy development and bugs, and wip shown to all (both of you who read this no doubt)

## New Site, new "CMS", new everything

Drupal does some very cool stuff and I'm still working in it however I guess its time for me to play with something new in the hopes that it will keep my drupal work and other projects more organised.
