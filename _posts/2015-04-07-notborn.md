## In what ways would the world be different if you hadn't been born?

If I had not been born, my niece's wouldn't have had an uncle quite like me, my brothers would have not had that third child annoying brother to put them through all the trials and tribulations that I'd think has adequately prepared them for life.
My beautiful girlfriend may not have found true love.

Work I may not have made as much a difference as I'd like to have made or like to think I have made but I have put in effort and like to think that some other employee's might not have so I may have made a difference there.

I do feel that my life is some part of a plan and I'm glad that I was born and I know some others that are glad of that too.

I don't think I've made a massive impact on the world but I'd like to make more as I go on, I have indeed learned to be content with what I have if I have plenty or if I have nothing, even if it's a struggle sometimes.

With other things I like to think I've stayed discontented as I strive to help people including my local church push towards their goals.

I like to think I've helped a few strangers, I have upset more than a few people, some drastically others not so much. Yet still others I have made it uncomfortable to see me. life is a struggle, challenge and the most rewarding all at the same time.
It can be simple or it can be complicated, sometimes it's both.
How have you made an impact?  is your life moving in the right direction?
are you who you want to be yet? No? How can we get there together?
